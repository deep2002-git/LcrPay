                    <h3>Part 3 – General Rules for a Successful Return</h3>
                    <p>In certain cases where the seller is unable to process a replacement for any reason whatsoever, a refund will be given.</p>
                    <p>During open box deliveries, while accepting your order, if you received a different or a damaged product, you will be given a refund (on-the-spot refunds for cash-on-delivery orders). Once you have accepted an open box delivery, no return request will be processed, except for manufacturing defects. In such cases, these category-specific replacement/return general conditions will be applicable. Click <a href="#">here</a> to know more about Open Box Delivery.</p>
                    <p>For products where installation is provided by Vypaarlist’s service partners, do not open the product packaging by yourself. Vypaarlist authorised personnel shall help in unboxing and installation of the product.</p>
                    <p>For Furniture, any product-related issues will be checked by authorised service personnel (free of cost) and attempted to be resolved by replacing the faulty/defective part of the product. Full replacement will be provided only in cases where the service personnel opines that replacing the faulty/defective part will not resolve the issue.</p>
